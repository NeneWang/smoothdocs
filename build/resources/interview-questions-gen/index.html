Interview prep 101 dictates that you should have your elevator pitch ready, a few stories polished, and a good sense of what you have to offer. So, how do you get there? Lots of practice, ideally aloud.
To help you better prepare for your next interview, here are 30 behavioral interview questions sorted by topic (in addition to 31 common interview questions here) that you can practice.
Not sure how to answer these questions? Here’s a quick guide on how to craft job-landing responses.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="teamwork">Teamwork<a class="hash-link" href="#teamwork" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For questions like these, you want a story that illustrates your ability to work with others under challenging circumstances.

How did you handle that?</li><li>Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?</li><li>We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.</li><li>Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive.

How did you go about doing so?</li><li>Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?</li><li>Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.</li><li>Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?</li><li>When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all.
